## Chapter 3 - Express JS

### [[ Chapter Notes ]] 
 
- **ExpressJS** is *de-facto* Node framework - and used in most Node applications which are used as web server.
- You can install express `npm install express`
- Express has few level of methods :
	- Application methods : e.g. app.use()
	- Request methods
	- Response methods
	- Middleware methods
	- Router methods

- **Response** methods (**res** is our response objects)
	- **res.send()** - for sending HTML
	- **res.sendFile(**) - for sending File
	- **res.json** - for sending JSON 
	- **res.sendStatus(404)** - for sending HTTP status only
	
- **HTTP Request** Types we generally use :
	- GET
	- POST
	- PUT
	- DELETE
	- PATCH
 - API / Endpoints / Routes are used inter-changeably but they are related to server paths.

- **Middle-ware** : Modifies the request before it reaches the next middleware or endpoints.
- Sequence of middleware is very important, as first middleware is first traversed by request.
- Middle-wares can be used for many use cases, like loggers, authentication, parsing data etc.
- Middle-ware can be :
	- Application level : server.use(**middleware**) 
	- Router level : server.get('/', **middleware**, (req,res)=>{})
	- Built-in middleware : **express.json()** [ for parsing body data], **express.static()**[for static hosting]
	- External Middle-wares - like **morgan**

- **Request** properties (**req** is our request object)
	- **req.ip** - IP address of client
	- **req.method** - HTTP method of request
	- **req.hostname** - like google.com / localhost
	- **req.query** - for capturing query parameters from URL e.g. localhost:8080 ? **query=value**
	- **req.body** -for capturing request body data (but its needs a middleware for body data decoding)
	-  **req.params** - for capturing URL parameters for route path like `/products/:id` 

- **Static Hosting** : we can make 1 or more folders as static hosted using **express.static** middleware.
	`server.use(express.static(< directory >))`
Static hosting is like sharing a folder/directory and making its file readable as it is.
Note : `index.html` is default file which would be read in a static hosted folder, if you don't mention any file name.

3 major ways of sending data from client to server via request are :

**1. Send data via URL in Query String**

This is easiest method to send data and mostly used in GET request.

When you have URL with  `?name=Youstart&subject=express`  at end, it translates in a query string. In query string each key,value pair is separated by  `=`  and between 2 such pairs we put  `&`.

To read such data in express you can use  `req.query`  :
```javascript
server.get("/demo",function(req,res){
    console.log(req.query) // prints all data in request object
    res.send(req.query);  // send back same data in response object
})
```

-  **Assignment 1** : 

Make above server with API endpoint  `/demo`  as shown above :

1.  Try to call this API in your browser  `http://localhost:8080/demo?name=Youstart`  - this will return a response of  `req.query`  JSON object
    
2.  Create 3 query parameters  `name`,  `age`,  `subject`  with some values. Check the final output of  `req.query`  - can you find all data on server side. Can you send it back to client via  `res`  object.
    

**2. Send data via Request Params**

In this method you can have a URL with url path like  `/Youstart/express`  at end it translates in a param string. In param part string each value is separated by  `/`. As you can see that URL only contains  `value`  not the  `key`  part of data.  `key`  part is decided by the endpoint definition at express server

server.get("/demo/:name/:subject",function(req,res){
    console.log(req.params) // prints all data in request object
    res.send(req.query);  // send back same data in response object
})

So sequence of values matter in this case. As values sent from client are matched with  `name`  and  `subject`  params of URL later.

-  **Assignment 2** : 

Make above server with API endpoint  `/demo`  as shown above :

1.  Try to call this API in your browser  `http://localhost:8080/demo/Youstart/Express`  - this will return a response of  `req.params`  JSON object
    
2.  Create 3 URL params  `name`,  `age`,  `subject`  . Call the URL and check the final output of  `req.params`  - can you find all data on server side. Can you send it back to client via  `res`  object.
    

**3. Send data via Request Body**

Final method of sending data is via body part of request. We can send data directly to body using URL. We have to either use one of these methods

1.  Use a HTML Form and make  `method`  value as  `POST`. This will make all name=value pair to go via body of request.
    
2.  Use special browsers like POSTMAN to change the body directly. (We will see this example in next classes)
    
```js
server.post("/demo",function(req,res){
    console.log(req.body) // prints all data in request object
    res.send(req.body);  // send back same data in response object
})
